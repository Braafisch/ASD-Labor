"""Helper function for re-projecting image points to the road surface and vice versa.

This module contains a class that can be used in the ASD lab gazebo simulation. 
It provides functions for re-projecting image points onto the 3D ground plane 
and projecting 3D points on the ground plane on to the image, bith using the known 
homography between image and ground plane.

Example:

  foo = ClassFoo()
  bar = foo.FunctionBar()
